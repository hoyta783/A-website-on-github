	<h1>Ashley Hoyt</h1>
		<p>My experience with web design and development started in Fall 2021. I have taken quite a few classes so far. I have created websites mostly on replit. From this course I hope to learn how to use Git and Github even more so after this module. It's exciting to get to work with others and collaborate because it makes gives some insight as to how an actual job in IT might be. I hope to use my knowledge in a job in the future.</p>
